      ''' I am a data-driven entrepreneur with a degree in economics at one of the leading universities in Russia. I have co-founded and led two innovative startups in the fields of computer vision and eye-tracking, leveraging my skills in project management, IT development, and venture capital.
As the CEO and co-founder of NeuroMetrix.AI, I have successfully launched and scaled an online, non-moderated UX/UI testing and A/B testing platform that uses eye-tracking technology directly from users' cameras on websites and Figma prototypes. Our platform empowers online B2C product owners and designers to gather valuable insights and enhance the user experience of their products. We have worked with clients from various industries, such as e-commerce, fintech, and media, and have received positive feedback and referrals. 
I am passionate about using data and technology to solve real-world problems and create positive social and environmental impact. I am eager to learn from and collaborate with other professionals who share the same vision and values. I believe that I can bring diverse perspectives and experiences to the team, as well as a strong work ethic and a growth mindset.
